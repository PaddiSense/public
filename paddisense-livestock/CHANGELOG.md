# PaddiSense Livestock — What's New

## 2026.8.17

**New installs get a randomly generated admin password instead of a known default.** On a
brand-new install the add-on now creates its admin account with a random password, written to a
protected file inside the add-on (`/data/.admin_initial_pw`) for you to read once, sign in with,
and change. **Existing installs are unaffected** — your current login still works. If your admin
account is still on the old default password, you will see a warning at start-up asking you to
change it.

**Every page now tells you if the box is not connected to PaddiSense.** A small, dismissable
note. It never blocks you or locks any page — it is there so a box that has quietly dropped its
connection does not look perfectly normal.

**Security: the factory database password is gone from the last two places it remained.** The
add-on now refuses to start with a blank credential rather than falling back to a known default.
No action needed on your part.

## 2026.8.16

**Faster start-up.** Removed duplicate code checks from add-on start — they already run in the build pipeline.

## 2026.8.15

**Maintenance release — no user-visible changes.** Internal build checks now report
honestly when they find problems (previously a counting bug could hide them), a
security test was brought in line with the hardening shipped in 2026.8.14, and the
shared look-and-feel files were refreshed. This update also delivers the database
credential improvements to every box via the catalog.

## 2026.8.14

**Security hardening — no user-visible changes.** Add-ons on your box now prove who they are with
a cryptographic token before they can change this add-on's licence or permissions. Previously,
being on the box's internal network was treated as sufficient proof.

## 2026.8.13

- A newly installed add-on now stays on its activation screen until you enter your licence.
  Nothing changes for an add-on you are already using: once it has been activated it keeps
  working, and a later licence change or renewal will not lock you out of your own data.
